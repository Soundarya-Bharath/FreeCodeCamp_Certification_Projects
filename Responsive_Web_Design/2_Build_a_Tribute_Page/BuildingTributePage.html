            <p>Charles Babbage (1791â€“1871) was an English mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer. He is credited with conceptualizing the first automatic mechanical computer, known as the Analytical Engine. His design was a precursor to modern computers and laid the foundation for the field of computing.</p>
